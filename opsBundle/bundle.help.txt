>The following chart shows the code structure of this plugin.
>The pattern reports and TrainPlayer© exports all start with the creation of a JSON file.
The file is created by this plugin and in the case of TrainPlayer© manifest exports the JSON is created by modifying the JMRI generated manifest JSON.
All the JSON files are written to the jsonManifests folder. They follow the illustrated format:
>These videos are recorded in the English language.
>The Track Pattern subroutine can generate pattern reports for tracks at a single location.
  Additionally, cars can be moved from track to track within a location,
  and optionally, if a car is moved onto a spur, the schedule for that spur can be applied.>Track Pattern and Switch List JSON format

>The Pattern Scripts plugin for JMRI is a suite of subroutines for JMRI Operations Pro.  The use of this plugin is documented in the following list of videos.
>The ops to ops (o2o) subroutine is a group of utilities that are designed to be the glue that allows JMRI Operations Pro to be the operations engine for TrainPlayer©.
  The idea is to expand the capability of TrainPlayer©'s Advanced Ops feature to include the operational flexibility of Operations Pro,
  while also eleminating the tedium of keeping two databases synchronised.
>The j Plus subroutine adds enhanced railroad detail to reports generated by both JMRI and this plugin.
>Data for this subroutine is entered into the text boxes or if the TrainPlayer subroutine is activated, the additional railroad detail is imported from the TrainPlayer layout.
>Not all fields need be entered.
>The enhanced fields are as follows:
>Operating Railroad Name
>This is railroad that owns or operates the tracks being modeled. Any name can be entered such as 'PRR' or 'BN UPRR Joint' or 'G&D'.
>Operational Territory
>This is the railroad's name for the part being modeled, such as 'Long Beach Intermodal Terminal' or 'Salem Glass Works Branch'.
>Location
>Where the the railroad is located, such as 'The Great Divide' or 'The Bronx, New York'.
>Year Modeled</h4>
>Which year the model railroad is based on, this is a mirror of 'JMRI/OperationsPro/Settings/Year Modeled'.
>The j Plus Subroutine
>Operating railroad, the one that owns the tracks.
>Territory. Name of the particular operation being modeled.
>Location of the prototype.
>Calendar year being modeled.
>Model railroad scale, from settings or TrainPlayer.
>Layout name, from settings or TrainPlayer.
