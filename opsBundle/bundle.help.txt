>Pattern Scripts plugin<
>Introduction<
>The Pattern Scripts plugin can be thought of as a framework for hosting subroutines for JMRI Operations Pro that require a user interface. This plugin comes with four subroutines; jPlus, Patterns, o2o and Throwback. A template is also included to serve as scaffolding for someone wishing to add their own subroutine. Although the subroutines are somewhat interdependent, they may be activated or deactivated individually as needed.</p>
>Organization<
>The following chart shows the code structure of this plugin.<
>Plugin Layout<
>PatternConfig.json<
>Each JMRI profile gets its own configuration file, which is named PatternConfig.json. It is found in the operations folder, and is used to provide custom settings for each profile and record user inputs.
>The description of each element is in blue<
>User editable keys are described in green<
>Select Tools/Edit Config File. If a mistake is made editing the PatternConfig.json file, the plugin will delete the file and provide a new one to start over with. Worst case the plugin may crash. If that should happed select Tools/Restart From Default.</p>
