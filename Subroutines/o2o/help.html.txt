<h2>o2o Subroutine</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The ops to ops (o2o) subroutine is a group of utilities that are designed to be the glue that allows JMRI Operations Pro to be the operations engine for TrainPlayer©.
  The idea is to expand the capability of TrainPlayer©'s Advanced Ops feature to include the flexibility of Operations Pro,
  while also eleminating the tedium of keeping two databases synchronised.</p>
