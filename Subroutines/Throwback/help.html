<h2>Throwback plugin</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The Throwback Subroutine is modeled on the idea of version control software. Commits are named and saved. In so doing snapshots are taken of the rolling stock data. Trains and routes may then be modified and test cases run, and equipment movement tested.</p>
<p>Further branches in testing can be made with additional commits.</p>
<p>Along the way the rolling can be thrown back to a commit, and the other segment of the branch explored.</p>
<p>When the experiments are done, the rolling stock is then thrown back to the first commit. The rolling stock is synchronized with the actulal layout, but the routes and trains remain modified.</p>
<p>The video explains this better</p>
