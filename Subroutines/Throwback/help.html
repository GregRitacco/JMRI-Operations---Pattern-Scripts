<h2>Throwback Subroutine</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The Throwback Subroutine is modeled on the idea of version control software. Commits are named and saved. In so doing snapshots are taken of the JMRI railroad data sets.</p>
<p>The commit then serves as a setpoint that allows any of the JMRI data sets to be reset to.</p>
<p>Commits are useful for testing 'What if?' ideas, or to simulate an ops session in advance of the actual ops session, or for testing the movement of rolling stock ETC.</p>
<p>This subroutine does not interact with JMRIs Auto Save or Auto Backup feature, they run as configured.</p>
<h3>How to use this subroutine</h3>
<p>The name of each commit is entered into the text box of the Total Commits frame. Enter the name BEFORE pressing the Add New Commit button.</p>
<p>Presing the Add New Commit button will add a new commit.</p>
<p>Pressing the Delete All Commits brings up a choice to confirm or cancel the commit. Pressing the Confirm button erases all saved commits, so be careful!</p>
<p>In the Action panel, the Previous and Next buttons facilitate scrolling through your collection of commits. The list is ordered by creation date/time.</p>
<p>Select any combination of data sets to be thrown back by clicking its check box.</p>
<p>Pressing the Throwback button sets the selected data sets to the displayed commit.</p>
