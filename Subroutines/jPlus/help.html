<h2>j Plus Subroutine</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The j Plus subroutine adds enhanced railroad detail to reports generated by both JMRI and this plugin.</P>
<p>Data for this subroutine is entered into the text boxes or if the TrainPlayer subroutine is activated, the additional railroad detail is imported from the TrainPlayer layout.</P>
<p>Not all fields need be entered.</P>
<p>The enhanced fields are as follows:</P>
<h4>Operating Railroad Name</h4>

<h4>Location</h4>
