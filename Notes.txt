  How to publish DeepL?
  lots of duplication in o2o.ScheduleAuteur symetric and asymetric.
  Duplication of PSE chunkPath.
  o2o. When a new car type is added, check the box for it at all locations.

Comments:
  Schedule does not prevent setting a car to a track.
  Setting JmriJFrame(True, True) has no effect, size and position are manually saved.
  Moved ENCODING value into the config file.
  Move config file master copy into psEntities to shield it from accidental edit.
  os.path.join() is used to make all paths for better OS compatibility.
  Plugin is Javafied as much as possible.
  _trackNameClickedOn moved to PSE.TRACK_NAME_CLICKED_ON
  o2o importTpRailroad rolled into the jPlus buttons.
  On TrainPlayer side, a check is added to validate locale is in format 'location;track'.
  On TrainPlayer side, a check is added to validate industries has a locale entry.'.
  Generalized built train listeners into opsEntities.Listeners.
  Translate the plugin does not delete the config file.
  TrainPlayer names the location for unlabeled tracks as 'Unreported'. o2o then imports this location as
  'Unreported' so as with other locations, the name is not translated.
  Since the Patterns track dict is created when called, it is not necessary to save it into configFile['Patterns']['PT']
  o2o Initialize Railroad does not reset Throwback.

Version 3 ideas:
  Add a new subroutine, streamlined trains window.
  Harden up Bundle against web errors, untranslated items.
  Harden Translator.translateSingle() from timeout errors.
  Replace RemoteCalls with listeners.
  How to use locale modifier, IE en-GB.
  Test formatText with ascii and others
  All the subroutine actionListener() are very similar. Can this duplication be eliminated?
  020.ModelWorkEvents.*.parsePtRs and o2o.ModelWorkEvents.*.parseRS do the same things in a different way, can they be merged?
  Implement mergeConfigFiles() maybe?
  jPlus integration into JMRI reports and web server.
  Start working on adding Patterns to the web server.
    Set Rolling Stock to Track button creates a train.
    Switch List button on Set Cars form adds work to the train and builds the train.
    The switch list train will display on the web server page.
    Use the conductor feature on the train to report work done and terminate the train.
    A train listener detects the terminated switch list train and deletes it.

Wish List:
  add Pattern Scripts to Operations Pro combo box?
  plugin added to button in trains window (AWT.getComponents())?
  jmri.util.swing.JMenuUtil.replaceMenuItem() to replace the trains window with a new trains window that includes a ps button?
