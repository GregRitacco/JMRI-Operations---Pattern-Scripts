Comments:
  why isnt jmri.jmrit.operations.rollingstock.cars.Car.testDestination()being used?
  schedule does not prevent setting a car to a track, should it?

Stuff that's OK:
  RWE and RWL seems to work ok
  Schedule overrides RWE/RWL OK
  no schedule, no RWE/RWL load toggles ok
  default load/empty toggling ok
  Ignore Track Length works with yard tracks
  Ignore Track Length works with schedules
  formatText formats ascii OK
  handle multiple versions OK
  test for file write locations OK
  config.json version check OK
  create JSON header OK
  create JSON body OK
  append JSON switchlist OK
  write JMRI location list to trainPlayer OK
  write JMRI workEvent list to TrainPlayer OK
  Report Title - Pattern Report edits OK
  Report Title - Set Cars edits OK
  Report Title - TrainPlayer edits OK
  Caboose and passenger move OK
  Catches pattern report no tracks selected OK
  TrainPlayer support implements OK
  formatText() works with utf-8 OK

Stuff to fix:
  Catch up with the latest JMRI stuff like text color
  add locos to json
  add internal logging to ExportToTrainPlayer.py
  set cars hold are being sent to (0)

Wish List:
  add Pattern Scripts to Operations Pro combo box
  plugin added to button in trains window (AWT.getComponents())
  jmri.util.swing.JMenuUtil.replaceMenuItem() to replace the trains window with a new trains window that includes a ps button
