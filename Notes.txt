Wish List:
  Next version, Set Cars windows add work to work list or docket, similar to TrainPlayer button, add Yardmaster button to Set Cars windows
  jmri.jmrit.operations.locations.YardmasterFrame(location)
  add Pattern Scripts to Operations Pro combo box
  plugin added to button in trains window (AWT.getComponents())
  jmri.util.swing.JMenuUtil.replaceMenuItem() to replace the trains window with a new trains window that includes a ps button
