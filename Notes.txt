  Language
    Language changes OK
    Language bundle sketched in, to be hardened against web errors
    Bundle added with French test case
    BUNDLE calls placed in 'View' methods only as much as possible
    Bundle creates new plugin and help page translations OK
    DYI version of concurrency seems to work OK.

  TrainPlayer
    Add a listener to monitor if a new train is created or deleted, builtTrain listeners updated accordingly
    Adding script to run on train built for TP export is not needed, but still can be done.
    TrainPlayer subroutine sketched in, to be expanded
    TrainPlayer integration harden with train built listeners
    TP Exports unicode OK
    TrainPlayer support implements OK
    ExportToTrainPlayer.py works as module OK
    ExportToTrainPlayer.py works as script OK
    When run as a stand alone script, ManifestForTrainPlayer does not read config file, which is correct

  KeyError when editing config file crashed plugin, bummer. Restart button bale out.
  Catches user add/remove train while TP export is enabled
  Catches user edit train while TP export is enabled

Version 3 ideas:
  Implement TrainPlayer Support subroutine.
  Implement mergeConfigFiles()
  Enhance and harden BUNDLE
  Start working on distributed JMRI
    Set Cars windows add work to work list or docket, similar to TrainPlayer button, add Yardmaster button to Set Cars windows. Work can then be reported as it's done.
    jmri.jmrit.operations.locations.YardmasterFrame(location)
    Phone based switch list crew can report work when done. Crews use train symbol as ID
    Maybe a custom Trains window with only the trains for each yard master location + pattern scripts

Wish List:
  add Pattern Scripts to Operations Pro combo box?
  plugin added to button in trains window (AWT.getComponents())?
  jmri.util.swing.JMenuUtil.replaceMenuItem() to replace the trains window with a new trains window that includes a ps button?
