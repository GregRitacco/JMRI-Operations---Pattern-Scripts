Stuff that's OK or comments:
  why isnt jmri.jmrit.operations.rollingstock.cars.Car.testDestination()being used?
  RWE and RWL seems to work ok
  Schedule overrides RWE/RWL OK
  no schedule, no RWE/RWL load toggles ok
  default load/empty toggling ok
  Ignore Track Length works with schedules
  formatText works OK
  handle multiple versions OK
  test for file write locations OK
  config json version check OK

Stuff to fix:
  Catch up with the latest JMRI stuff like text color

Wish List:
  CBB ViewsetCarsForm.makeTrackButtonRow(allTracksAtLoc) relies on too much hardcoding
  plugin added to button in trains window
  set cars window add trainplayer compatability
  jmri.util.swing.JMenuUtil.replaceMenuItem() to replace the trains window with a new trains window that includes a ps button
