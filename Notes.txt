  why isnt jmri.jmrit.operations.rollingstock.cars.Car.testDestination()being used?
  schedule does not prevent setting a car to a track, should it?

Stuff that's OK:
  RWE and RWL seems to work ok
  Schedule overrides RWE/RWL OK
  no schedule, no RWE/RWL load toggles ok
  default load/empty toggling ok
  Ignore Track Length works with yard tracks
  Ignore Track Length works with schedules
  formatText formats ascii OK
  handle multiple versions OK
  test for file write locations OK
  config.json version check OK
  create JSON header OK
  create JSON body OK
  append JSON switchlist OK
  write JMRI location list to trainPlayer OK
  write JMRI workEvent list to TrainPlayer OK
  Report Title - Pattern Report edits OK
  Report Title - Set Cars edits OK
  Report Title - TrainPlayer edits OK
  Caboose and passenger move OK
  Catches pattern report no tracks selected OK
  TrainPlayer support implements OK
  formatText() works with utf-8 OK
  set cars to 'Hold' works OK
  catches empty boxes added to jmri.jmrit.operations.setup.Setup.getLocalSwitchListMessageFormat() OK
  catches invalid track typed into set cars box OK
  ExportToTrainPlayer.py works as module OK
  ExportToTrainPlayer.py works as script OK
  Train name, train comments matrix added to config file
  CSV pattern and list written OK
  locos in report follow jmri.jmrit.operations.setup.Setup.getDropEngineMessageFormat OK
  cars in report follow jmri.jmrit.operations.setup.Setup.getLocalCarMessageFormat OK
  Caboose and Passenger car types are loaded as O for Occupied OK

Todo:
  Catch up with the latest JMRI stuff like text color
  UGH!! Left justify set cars lists
  Revisit why class LocationComboBox(java.awt.event.ActionListener) is nested in startup
  breakout ExportToTrainPlayer?
  rework ExportJmriLocations().toTrainPlayer(self)

Wish List:
  Sort out naming convention Set Cars vs Pattern Report for Track
  for getDetailsForLocoAsDict(locoObject) add loco include elements to the json config file similar to: jmri.jmrit.operations.setup.Setup.getLocalSwitchListMessageFormat()
  add Pattern Scripts to Operations Pro combo box
  plugin added to button in trains window (AWT.getComponents())
  jmri.util.swing.JMenuUtil.replaceMenuItem() to replace the trains window with a new trains window that includes a ps button
