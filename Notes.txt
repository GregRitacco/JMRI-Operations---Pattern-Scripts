Version 3 ideas:
  Work in divisions.
  Add check for updates.
  Maybe move o2o model FILE_LIST to configFile.json?
  020.ModelWorkEvents.*.parsePtRs and o2o.ModelWorkEvents.*.parseRS do the same things in a different way, can they be merged?
  Harden up Bundle against web errors, untranslated items.
  How to use locale modifier, IE en-GB.
  Implement mergeConfigFiles()
  Start working on distributed JMRI
    Set Cars windows add work to work list or docket, similar to TrainPlayer button, add Yardmaster button to Set Cars windows. Work can then be reported as it's done.
    jmri.jmrit.operations.locations.YardmasterFrame(location)
    Phone based switch list crew can report work when done. Crews use train symbol as ID
    Maybe a custom Trains window with only the trains for each yard master location + pattern scripts

Wish List:
  add Pattern Scripts to Operations Pro combo box?
  plugin added to button in trains window (AWT.getComponents())?
  jmri.util.swing.JMenuUtil.replaceMenuItem() to replace the trains window with a new trains window that includes a ps button?
