Todo:
  How to publish DeepL?
  Try to add sequence to the car xml:
    https://webserver.jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrit/operations/rollingstock/RollingStockAttribute.html#store(org.jdom2.Element,java.lang.String,java.lang.String)
  Maybe put Dest and FD standins into TextReports.py?
  Change Patterns back to moving a car on a train?
  Refine Hazardous handling.
  set rs to track doesnt work

Duplicate code:
  o2o.ScheduleAuteur symetric and asymetric.
  PSE chunkPath.
  PSE pickupCar, dropCar localCar
  
Comments:
  Schedule does not prevent setting a car to a track.
  Setting JmriJFrame(True, True) has no effect, size and position are manually saved.
  Moved ENCODING value into the config file.
  Move config file master copy into psEntities to shield it from accidental edit.
  os.path.join() is used to make all paths for better OS compatibility.
  Plugin is Javafied as much as possible.
  _trackNameClickedOn moved to PSE.TRACK_NAME_CLICKED_ON
  o2o importTpRailroad rolled into the jPlus buttons.
  On TrainPlayer side, a check is added to validate locale is in format 'location;track'.
  On TrainPlayer side, a check is added to validate industries has a locale entry.'.
  Generalized built train listeners into opsEntities.Listeners.
  Translate the plugin does not delete the config file.
  o2o Initialize Railroad does not reset Throwback.
  Replace __import__ with importlib.import_module()

Version 3 ideas:
  Finish extendedDestionationHandling and extendedFinalDestionationHandling.
  Possibly process event messages to ease reading the log file.
  Harden up Bundle against web errors, untranslated items.
  Harden Translator.translateSingle() from timeout errors.
  How to use locale modifier, IE en-GB.
  Test formatText with ascii and others.
  Implement mergeConfigFiles() maybe?

  Start working on adding Patterns to the web server.
    jPlus integration into JMRI reports and web server.
    Set Rolling Stock to Track button creates a train (switch list as a train).
    Add a new subroutine, streamlined trains window that only displayes the switch lists as trains.
    Switch List button on Set Cars form adds work to the train and builds the train.
    The switch list as a train will display on the web server page.
    Use the conductor feature on the train to report work done and terminate the train.
    A train listener detects the terminated switch list train and deletes it.

Wish List:
  add Pattern Scripts to Operations Pro combo box?
  plugin added to button in trains window (AWT.getComponents())?
  jmri.util.swing.JMenuUtil.replaceMenuItem() to replace the trains window with a new trains window that includes a ps button?
