jmri.util.JmirJFrame.getFrameList() to find open windows?
log no FD set due to track length exception

test if Ignore Track Length works with schedules.

maybe use trackobject.getUsedLength

change View.manageGui to View.ManageGui

RWE and RWL are not being set

why isnt jmri.jmrit.operations.rollingstock.cars.Car.testDestination()being used?
