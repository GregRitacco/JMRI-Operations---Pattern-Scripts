<h2>o2o Subroutine</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The ops to ops (o2o) subroutine is a group of utilities that are designed to be the glue that allows JMRI Operations Pro to be the operations engine for TrainPlayer©. The idea is to expand the capability of TrainPlayer©'s Advanced Ops feature to include the flexibility of Operations Pro, while also eleminating the tedium of keeping two data sets synchronised.</p>
<p>o2o will automatically export a built train or switchlist to TrainPlayer when the Pattern Scripts window is open and the o2o subroutine is included. To disable o2o export, Remove o2o from the Pattern Scripts window or close (not hide) the Pattern Scripts window.</p>
<h3>How to use this subroutine</h3>
<p>Before any of these buttons are pressed, export your layout from TrainPlayer. The QuickKeys for TrainPlayer subroutines have to be added to TrainPlayer before your TrainPlayer layout can be exported. Refer to the Quick Keys documentation.</p>

<h4>Initialize Railroad</h4>
<p>Pressing this button initializes the Locations, Cars, and Engines data sets so a new JMRI railroad can be built from the TrainPlayer export. The Routes and Trains XML files are backed up.</p>
<h4>Import Locations</h4>
<p>Pressing this button builds a whole new JMRI railroad from the TrainPlayer export data. If you are using jPlus, the extended data you entered into the TrainPlayer layout will be added.</p>
<p>Additionally, when making any subsequent changes to the Locations panel of TrainPlayer's Advanced Ops window, re-export your TrainPlayer layout and press this button to update your JMRI data.</p>
<p>Pressing Import Locations also imports/updates Industries and Cars.</p>
<h4>Import Industries</h4>
<p>Press this button when you have made changes to TrainPlayers Advanced Ops Industries panel, This will update your spurs and their schedules. Any changes you have made to your rolling stock are also updated.</p>
<p>Pressing Import Industries also imports/updates Cars.</p>
<h4>Import Cars</h4>
<p>Press this button when you have made changes to the rolling stock on your TrainPlayer layout.</p>
<h4>Extended Detail</h4>
<p>Pressing this button will add the extended railroad details entered into the TrainPlayer Quick Keys Personalized Settings into jPlus. This is optional.</p>
<h3>Who does what</h3>
<p>One of the primary purposes of o2o is to eliminate duplication between your TrainPlayer and JMRI layouts. As much as possible, layout maintenance is done on your TrainPlayer layout and the changes are then pushed to your JMRI layout.</p>
<p>The table below shows which program manages which elements of your layout.</p>
<img src="../Subroutines_Activated/o2o/img/Who_Does_What.png" alt="<Who Does What Image>">
<p>Use TrainPlayer to manage Layout Details, Cars, Engines, Schedules, and Locations.</p>
<p>Use TrainPlayer to define Divisions and Tracks, and use JMRI to implement the details.</p>
<p>Use JMRI to manage all aspects of Routes and Trains.</p>
<p>As your JMRI layout becomes more nuanced, data set management will by necessity become increasingly shared (but not duplicated) between the two programs.</p>

<h4>User Settings for the o2o section of configFile.json</h4>
<pre>
  The o2o section of the configuration file has the following user editable settings.
  The TrainPlayer car code lists are grouped by types of equipment, based on default TrainPlayer values.
  Any car code not listed is considered a manifest freight car.
  Custom car codes added to TrainPlayer would also be added here.
