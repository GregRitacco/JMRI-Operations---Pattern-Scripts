<h2>Patterns Subroutine</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The Patterns subroutine can generate pattern reports for tracks at a single location. Additionally, cars can be moved from track to track within a location. Optionally, if a car is moved onto a spur, the schedule for that spur can be applied.</p>
<h3>How to use this subroutine</h3>
<p>If you are using divisions, the Division drop down will display a list of divisions. Selecting a division will load a list of locations for that division into the Location drop down.</p>
<p>With a location selected, a list of check boxes will display, one for each track at the selected location.</p>
<p>The list of tracks can be filtered by clicking the 'Yard Tracks Only' check box on or off.</p>
<p>Individual tracks can be selected by clicking the check box next to the track name.</p>
<p>With tracks selected, pressing the Track Inquiry button will display inventory information (Pattern Report) about the selected tracks. This is printable.</p>
<p>If Tools/Options/Generate CSV Switch List is selected. The Pattern Report will be added to the csvSwitchLists folder as a CSV file.</p>
<p>With tracks selected, pressing the Set Rolling Stock to Track button will pop open one worklist for each track selected.</p>
<p>For each worklist window, a row of buttons, one for each track of the selected location, will display. Pressing one of the track buttons will load the track name into memory.</p>
<p>For any of the rolling stock rows in the Cars At... panel, clicking inside of one of the text boxes will paste the selected track name into the box.</p>
<p>Pressing the + Switch List button will generate a switch list of work for that track. This is printable.</p>
<p>If Tools/Options/Generate CSV Switch List is selected. The switch list will be added to the csvSwitchLists folder as a CSV file.</p>
<p>If o2o is being used, a TrainPlayer work list will also be generated.</p>
<p>Pressing the Set Rolling Stock to Track button will open the Additional Choices pop up.</p>
<p>The pop up adds the option to use a spurs schedule and overide track capacity.</p>
<p>Pressing the Set Cars button will cause the rolling stock in the worklist to be moved to the selected track, subject to type restrictions.</p>
