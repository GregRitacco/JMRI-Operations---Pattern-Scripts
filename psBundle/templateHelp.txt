>Guard rails of sorts have been put up around the values marked in green, but even so this plugin is not able to catch every type of mistake. In some cases the plugin might crash. If that happens, press the 'Restart from PatternConfig Backup" button and the plugin will use the last good PatternConfig.json file as a new starting off point. In other cases, if a mistake is made editing the PatternConfig.json file, the plugin will replace it with the default file, and the user will have to start over.

All the JSON files are written to the jsonManifests folder. They follow the illustrated format:

>This program is a plugin for JMRI Operations Pro. With it, the user can generate pattern reports for tracks at a single location. Additionally, cars can be moved from track to track within a location, and optionally, if a car is moved onto a spur, the schedule for that spur can be applied. Support for my TrainPlayer suite of scripts is also included. The use of this plugin is documented in the following list of videos.
