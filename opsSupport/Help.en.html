<h1>Help Page - Pattern Scripts plugin for JMRI</h1>
<p>The Pattern Scripts plugin for JMRI is a suite of subroutines for JMRI Operations Pro. The use of this plugin is documented in the following list of YouTube videos. The videos are recorded in the English language.</p>

<h2>Pattern Scripts plugin</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The Pattern Scripts plugin can be thought of as a framework for hosting subroutines (or scripts) for JMRI Operations Pro that require a user interface. This plugin comes with four subroutines; jPlus, Patterns, o2o and Throwback. A template is also included to serve as scaffolding for someone wishing to add their own subroutine.</p>
<p>Subroutines may be added or removed individually as needed.</p>
<p>Additionally, each subroutine can be shown or hidden as needed, fron the Tools menu pulldown.</p>
<p>Each of the subroutines' features are only available when the plugin is running and the subroutine has been included.
For example, extended railroad details will only appear in reports when the Pattern Scripts plugin has been started, and jPlus has been included.
To deactivate the plugins features, close (not hide) the window.</p>
<h3>Organization</h3>
<p>The following chart shows the code structure of this plugin.</P>

<h3>Plugin Layout</h3>

<img src="./img/Plugin_Layout.png" alt="<Plugin Layout Image>">
<h3>configFile.json</h3>
<p>Each JMRI profile gets its own configuration file, which is named configFile.json. It is found in the operations folder, and is used to provide custom settings for each profile and record user inputs.</p>
<p>Select Tools/Edit Config File. The values that are user editable are in subsections labeled "US" for User Settings. Other values should not be edited.
If a mistake is made editing the configFile, the plugin will delete the file and provide a new one to start over using default values.
Worst case, the plugin may crash. If that should happed select Tools/Restart From Default.</p>
<h4>User Settings for the Main Script section of configFile.json</h4>

<h2>jPlus Subroutine</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The jPlus subroutine adds extended railroad detail to reports generated by this plugin. This detail is displayed as the header for pattern reports and switch lists. The header for the JMRI server is not changed.</P>
  <h3>How To Use</h3>
<p>To use this subroutine. enter the appropriate data into the text box and click update. Not all fields need to be entered. To include the extended detail in a Operations Pattern Scripts report, click the 'Use Extended Header' checkbox. The extended fields are as follows:</P>
<h4>Operating Railroad Name</h4>
<p>This is railroad that owns or operates the tracks being modeled. Any name can be entered such as 'PRR' or 'BN UPRR Joint' or 'G&D'.</P>
<h4>Operational Territory</h4>
<p>This is the railroad's name for the part being modeled, such as 'Long Beach Intermodal Terminal' or 'Salem Glass Works Branch'.</P>
<h4>Location</h4>
<p>Where the the railroad is located, such as 'The Great Divide' or 'The Bronx, New York'.</P>
<h4>Year Modeled</h4>
<p>Which year the model railroad is based on, this is a mirror of 'JMRI/OperationsPro/Settings/Year Modeled'. Either updates the other.</p>

<!-- o2o help section html -->
<h2>o2o Subroutine</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The ops to ops (o2o) subroutine is a group of utilities that are designed to be the glue that allows JMRI Operations Pro to be the operations engine for TrainPlayer©. The idea is to expand the capability of TrainPlayer©'s Advanced Ops feature to include the flexibility of Operations Pro, while also eleminating the tedium of keeping two databases synchronised.</p>
<p>o2o will automatically export a built train or switchlist to TrainPlayer when the Pattern scripts window is open and the o2o subroutine is displayed. To disable o2o export, disable o2o from the Tools pulldown or close the Pattern Scripts window.</p>
<h3>What the buttons do</h3>
<p>Before any of these buttons are pressed, export your layout from TrainPlayer. The QuickKeys for TrainPlayer subroutines have to be added to TrainPlayer before your TrainPlayer layout can be exported. Refer to the Quick Keys documentation.</p>
<p><A HREF="https://github.com/gar-codespace/QuickKeys-for-TrainPlayer">The Quick Keys page on GitHub</A></p>
<p>New JMRI Railroad - Pressing this button erases any existing data and builds a new JMRI railroad from the Advanced Ops window via a TrainPlayer export. The Routes and Trains XML files are backed up, the others are discarded.</p>
<p>Update Locations - Pressing this button updates your JMRI railroad to the changes made to the TrainPlayer Advanced Ops Locations and Industries tabs, along with any changes made to your TrainPlayer rolling stock.</p>
<p>Update Industries - Pressing this button only applies changes made to the TrainPlayer Advanced Ops Industries tab. Nothing else is updated. This effectively updates only JMRI schedule data.</p>
<p>Update Rolling Stock - Pressing this button applies changes made to your TrainPlayer rolling stock to your JMRI rolling stock. If a change is made to existing cars, the final destination is not overwritten.</p>

<h2>Patterns Subroutine</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The Patterns subroutine can generate pattern reports for tracks at a single location. Additionally, cars can be moved from track to track within a location. Optionally, if a car is moved onto a spur, the schedule for that spur can be applied.</p>
<h3>What the buttons do</h3>
<p>If you are using divisions, the Division drop down will display a list of divisions. Selecting a division will load a list of locations for that division into the Location drop dow.</p>
<p>The Location drop down will display a list of locations for your layout, or just the locations assigned to the selected division.</p>
<p>With a location selected, a list of check boxes will display, one for each track at the selected location.</p>
<p>The list of tracks can be filtered by clicking the 'Yard Tracks Only' check box on or off.</p>
<p>Individual tracks can be selected by clicking the check box next to the track name.</p>
<p>With tracks selected, pressing the Pattern Report button will display inventory information about the selected tracks. This is printable.</p>
<p>With tracks selected, pressing the Set Rolling Stock to Track button will pop open one worklist for each track selected.</p>
<p>For each worklist window, a row of buttons, one for each track of the selected location, will display. Pressing one of the track buttons will load the track name into memory.</p>
<p>For any of the rolling stock rows in the Cars At... panel, clicking inside of one of the text boxes will paste the selected track name into the box.</p>
<p>Pressing the Switch List button will generate a switch list of work for that track. This is printable. If o2o is being used, a TrainPlayer work list will also be generated.</p>
<p>Pressing the Set Rolling Stock to Track button will open a pop up.</p>
<p>The pop up adds the option to use a spurs schedule and overide track capacity.</p>
<p>Pressing the Set Cars button will cause the rolling stock in the worklist to be moved to the selected track, subject to type restrictions.</p>

<!-- Throwback help section html -->
<h2>Throwback Subroutine</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The Throwback Subroutine is modeled on the idea of version control software. Commits are named and saved. In so doing snapshots are taken of the railroads data.</p>
<p>The commit then serves as a setpoint that allows any of the JMRI data sets to be reset to.</p>
<p>This subroutine does not interact with JMRIs Auto Save or Auto Backup feature, they run as configured.</p>
<h3>What the buttons do</h3>
<p>The name of each commit is entered into the text box of the Total Commits frame. Enter the name BEFORE pressing the Add New Commit button.</p>
<p>Presing the Add New Commit button will add a new commit.</p>
<p>Pressing the Delete All Commits brings up a choice to confirm or cancel the commit. Pressing the Confirm button erases all saved commits, so be careful!</p>
<p>In the Actions panel, the Previous and Next buttons facilitate scrolling through your collection of commits. The list is ordered by creation date/time.</p>
<p>Select any combination of data sets to be thrown back by clicking its check box.</p>
<p>Pressing the Throwback button sets the selected data sets to the displayed commit.</p>
