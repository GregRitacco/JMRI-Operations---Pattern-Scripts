<h2>Pattern Scripts plugin</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The Pattern Scripts plugin can be thought of as a framework for hosting subroutines (or scripts) for JMRI Operations Pro that require a user interface. This plugin comes with four subroutines; jPlus, Patterns, o2o and Throwback. A template is also included to serve as scaffolding for someone wishing to add their own subroutine.</p>
<p>Subroutines may be added or removed individually as needed.</p>
<p>Additionally, each subroutine can be shown or hidden as needed, fron the Tools menu pulldown.</p>
<p>Each of the subroutines' features are only available when the plugin is running and the subroutine has been included. For example, extended railroad details will only appear in reports when the Pattern Scripts plugin has been started, and jPlus has been included. To deactivate the plugins features, close (not hide) the window.</p>
<h3>Organization</h3>

<h3>configFile.json</h3>
<p>Each JMRI profile gets its own configuration file, which is named configFile.json. It is found in the operations folder, and is used to provide custom settings for each profile and record user inputs.</p>
<p>Select Tools/Edit Config File. The values that are user editable are in subsections labeled "US" for User Settings. Other values should not be edited. If a mistake is made editing the configFile, the plugin will delete the file and provide a new one to start over using default values. Worst case, the plugin may crash. If that should happed select Tools/Restart From Default.</p>
<h4>User Settings for the Main Script section of configFile.json</h4>
<pre>
  The following are user editable values for the plugin.
  For colors, any of the A, B, G, R values can be changed, between 0 and 255.
  Also, new colors may be added.

<h2>Throwback Subroutine</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The Throwback Subroutine is modeled on the idea of version control software. Commits are named and saved. In so doing snapshots are taken of the JMRI railroad data sets.</p>
<p>The commit then serves as a setpoint that allows any of the JMRI data sets to be reset to.</p>
<p>Commits are useful for testing 'What if?' ideas, or to simulate an ops session in advance of the actual ops session, or for testing the movement of rolling stock ETC.</p>
<p>This subroutine does not interact with JMRIs Auto Save or Auto Backup feature, they run as configured.</p>
<h3>How to use this subroutine</h3>
<p>The name of each commit is entered into the text box of the Total Commits frame. Enter the name BEFORE pressing the Add New Commit button.</p>
<p>Presing the Add New Commit button will add a new commit.</p>
<p>Pressing the Delete All Commits brings up a choice to confirm or cancel the commit. Pressing the Confirm button erases all saved commits, so be careful!</p>
<p>In the Action panel, the Previous and Next buttons facilitate scrolling through your collection of commits. The list is ordered by creation date/time.</p>
<p>Select any combination of data sets to be thrown back by clicking its check box.</p>
<p>Pressing the Throwback button sets the selected data sets to the displayed commit.</p>
